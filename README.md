# Sales-Forecast-With-Multiple-Models
In this project, we will be forecasting quantity sales from ParagonCorp's dataset using multiple time series models such as:
- Bidirectional LSTM
- SARIMA
- NeuralProphet
This project aims to explore the dataset, visualize the trends and seasonality, and develop and accurate model based on the evaluation metrics. 

The best model will be used for forecasting future values of quantity sales to help the company make data-driven decisions, optimize operations, and stay competitive in the marketplace.
